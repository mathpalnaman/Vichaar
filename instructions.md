# ðŸ“Œ Idea Validation & Novelty Analysis App

This project helps users validate if their startup/product idea is already existing or not, and how to make it more novel and impactful. It leverages patent databases, startup directories, LLMs, and market trend signals.

---

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (UI, Form Input, Results Display)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (API endpoints, LLM coordination, scraping, similarity logic)
- **LLM**: Gemini API (Google's LLM for query generation, suggestions)
- **Embedding Model**: `sentence-transformers` (MiniLM or similar)
- **Database**: SQLite (initial), upgrade to PostgreSQL or Supabase when scaling
- **Scraping Libraries**: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup4`, `playwright` (for dynamic content)

## ðŸ§© Modules Breakdown

### 1. User Prompt Input

- Text input form for user's idea description (long-form supported)
- Submit to FastAPI backend

### 2. Gemini Query Expansion

- Generate 5â€“10 relevant search queries (natural language style)
- Example Prompt: "Based on this idea, generate queries for searching similar concepts on Google Patents, Crunchbase, and Google Trends."

### 3. Data Sources

#### ðŸ“˜ Patent Search (Google Patents)

- Scrape top 5 results per query
- Extract: Title, abstract, claim text if available, URL

#### ðŸš€ Startup Directory (Crunchbase or similar)

- Scrape startup descriptions, funding rounds, categories, etc.
- Focus on: similar space, similar value proposition

#### ðŸ“ˆ Market Trends (Google Trends API or scraping)

- Check for user idea's popularity
- Analyze interest over time and region

### 4. Semantic Similarity Engine

- Embed user idea and documents (patents, startup descriptions)
- Use cosine similarity to rank matches
- Top 5 similar items shown to user

### 5. LLM-Powered Suggestions (Gemini)

- "How to make it novel?"
- "What market niches are under-served?"
- "What features would improve uniqueness and feasibility?"

### 6. Database (Optional but Recommended)

- Store: user prompts, results, feedback, timestamps
- Helps in analytics, logging, tracking progress
